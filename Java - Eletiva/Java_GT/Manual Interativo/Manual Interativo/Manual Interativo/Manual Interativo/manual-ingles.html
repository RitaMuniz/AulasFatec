    <summary>What is the purpose of the reforestation system?</summary>

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why does a message appear saying the year already exists?</summary>
    <p>This happens because each year can only have one reforestation record, the system prevents duplicate entries to avoid errors and keep data organized.</p>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I track the progress of reforestation?</summary>
